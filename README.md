# Dynamic Component BOM 
(a Sketchup Plugin Project)

The Sketchup Plugin Script will generate a summarized list (Summary BOM) of dynamic components that have a value in the `ItemCode` attribute.
It will also record the `Description DC` attribute of dynamic components. 

By default the script will create an HTML report, but it will create a csv by just changing the extension to '.csv'.

| file extension |               description                |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| .html          | Webpage with BOM list as table.          |
| .csv           | Comma-seperated-values table.            |
| .md            | Markdown Document with BOM list as table |
|                |                                          |


| Item | Description | Quantity |
|------|-------------|----------|
|      |             |          |
